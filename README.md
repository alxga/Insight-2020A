# MBTA: My Best Transit App

The application collects General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Real-Time (RT) vehicle positions feeds (every 5 seconds) and GTFS schedule tables (once a day and only if there is an update) (both are published by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority). The collected data are processed to provide hourly statistics on service delays (in seconds) through a user-friendly web-interface. The web-interface allows analysts accessing the data aggregated by routes, stops, or a combination thereof.
